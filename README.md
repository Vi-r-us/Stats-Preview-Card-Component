# Stats Preview Card Component

I created a Stats Preview Card Component, featuring a modern-looking UI design that is responsive to all screen sizes. This project was developed as part of the [Frontend Mentor challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/stats-preview-card-component-8JqbgoU62). To achieve responsiveness, I utilized a grid layout combined with media queries. Additionally, I added webkit animations to enhance the loading experience.
